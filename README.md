# Case Study during the WBS-DataScience-Bootcamp: Expansion of Eniac to the Brazilian Market via Magist

## Project Overview

This project investigates the potential expansion of Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, into the Brazilian market. Brazil, with its rapidly growing eCommerce sector, presents a promising opportunity for Eniac's expansion. However, the market also poses challenges, particularly in terms of product-market fit and logistical efficiency.

To determine the feasibility of this expansion, the project involves a detailed analysis of the Brazilian market, focusing on factors such as sales trends, customer demographics, and delivery logistics. Data exploration was performed using SQL (MySQL Workbench), and insights were visualized using Tableau. The findings and recommendations were compiled into a comprehensive presentation created in Google Slides.

## Summary of Key Insights

- **Product Fit**: The analysis explored whether Eniac's Apple-compatible accessories would be successful in Brazilian marketplaces, given the region's specific consumer preferences and market conditions. The findings indicated that while there is some alignment between Magist's product categories and Eniac’s offerings, the overall market for high-end tech products remains uncertain. This is particularly relevant considering Magist’s focus on connecting smaller stores, which may not cater primarily to high-end tech buyers.

- **Sales Distribution**: The data showed that Magist's sales are concentrated in major economic regions like São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais, where consumer purchasing power is higher. However, sales are notably lower in the northern regions of Brazil, where lower average incomes and logistical challenges could hinder Eniac's success. This geographic disparity could affect the scalability of Eniac's business model in Brazil.

- **Delivery Performance**: The project assessed delivery times across various regions in Brazil, evaluating whether Magist's logistics network could meet Eniac’s standards for fast and reliable deliveries. While delivery times in major cities are acceptable (ranging from 3 to 7 business days), delivery to more remote areas, especially in the north, can take up to 15 days. This could be a significant drawback for Eniac, where fast delivery is a key component of customer satisfaction.

- **Customer Satisfaction**: Magist's services have generally received positive reviews, with an average rating of 4.1 out of 5. This suggests a strong base of satisfied customers, although there are isolated complaints about delivery issues and product defects. These reviews indicate that while Magist has a good reputation, there are still potential risks in customer experience that Eniac needs to consider.

- **Market Potential**: The analysis highlighted Brazil’s eCommerce growth potential, which is on par with other significant markets like Spain and Italy. Brazil's eCommerce market is projected to more than double in size from $53 billion USD in 2018 to $126 billion USD by 2024. This growth trajectory offers a compelling opportunity for Eniac, provided that the challenges of product fit, regional disparities, and logistics can be effectively managed.
