# Case Study during the WBS-DataScience-Bootcamp: Expansion of Eniac to the Brazilian Market via Magist

## Project Overview

Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, was founded in Spain and has successfully expanded to neighboring countries. Now, Eniac is exploring an entry into the Brazilian market—a region with eCommerce revenue comparable to Spain and Italy, and with significant growth potential. However, Eniac faces a major challenge: a limited understanding of the Brazilian market.

To address this, Eniac is considering a partnership with Magist, a prominent Brazilian Software as a Service (SaaS) company that provides a centralized order management system. Magist connects small and medium-sized stores to the largest Brazilian marketplaces, leveraging its economies of scale to offer competitive advantages.

Despite Magist's strong market presence, Eniac has two key concerns:

1. **Product Fit**: Eniac's product catalog is entirely focused on high-end tech, particularly Apple-compatible accessories. There is uncertainty about whether the marketplaces Magist serves are the right platform for such premium products.
  
2. **Delivery Speed**: Fast delivery is crucial to Eniac’s customer satisfaction strategy. While Magist’s partnership with the Brazilian Post Office may offer cost-effective delivery, there are concerns about whether delivery times will meet Eniac’s standards.

To address these concerns, this project involved data exploration using MySQL Workbench and data visualization with Tableau, providing insights to guide Eniac’s decision on entering the Brazilian market.

## Summary of Key Insights

- **Growth Potential**: Brazil’s eCommerce market is rapidly expanding, with revenue expected to more than double by 2024, making it a promising yet challenging market for Eniac’s entry.

- **Product-Market Fit**: Eniac’s high-end Apple-compatible accessories may not align perfectly with the typical product offerings on Magist’s connected marketplaces.

- **Revenue Gap**: Magist’s total revenue remains small compared to Eniac’s expectations, suggesting that Eniac may need to temper its financial projections if partnering with Magist.

- **Geographical Sales Disparities**: Magist’s sales are heavily concentrated in wealthier regions like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, while northern regions see significantly lower sales, posing a challenge for nationwide expansion.

- **Logistical Challenges**: Delivery times are acceptable in major cities but can extend up to 30 days in remote areas, potentially compromising Eniac's commitment to fast shipping.

- **Customer Feedback**: While Magist enjoys a solid reputation with an average customer rating of 4.1/5, occasional delivery and product issues highlight areas for improvement in customer experience.

## Final conclusion

Our study concludes that while partnering with Magist could be beneficial, skalability concerns lead to the advise that alternatives like Mercado Libre, Novatrade, or the fulfillment services of bigger players like Amazon or Shopify should be considered before signing binding contracts with Magist.
