# Case Study during the WBS-DataScience-Bootcamp: Expansion of Eniac to the Brazilian Market via Magist

## Project Overview

Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, was founded in Spain and has successfully expanded to neighboring countries. Now, Eniac is exploring an entry into the Brazilian market—a region with eCommerce revenue comparable to Spain and Italy, and with significant growth potential. However, Eniac faces a major challenge: a limited understanding of the Brazilian market.

To address this, Eniac is considering a partnership with Magist, a prominent Brazilian Software as a Service (SaaS) company that provides a centralized order management system. Magist connects small and medium-sized stores to the largest Brazilian marketplaces, leveraging its economies of scale to offer competitive advantages.

Despite Magist's strong market presence, Eniac has two key concerns:

1. **Product Fit**: Eniac's product catalog is entirely focused on high-end tech, particularly Apple-compatible accessories. There is uncertainty about whether the marketplaces Magist serves are the right platform for such premium products.
  
2. **Delivery Speed**: Fast delivery is crucial to Eniac’s customer satisfaction strategy. While Magist’s partnership with the Brazilian Post Office may offer cost-effective delivery, there are concerns about whether delivery times will meet Eniac’s standards.

To address these concerns, this project involved data exploration using MySQL Workbench and data visualization with Tableau, providing insights to guide Eniac’s decision on entering the Brazilian market.

## Tools Used

- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)**
  - Utilized to extract and analyze data, offering detailed insights into market trends, sales performance, and delivery logistics in the Brazilian market. SQL queries helped uncover critical data points that informed the decision-making process.

- **Tableau**
  - Used to create visualizations, including maps and bar charts, to effectively represent the data. Tableau's interactive dashboards provided a clear and visual interpretation of complex data, aiding in the communication of key insights.

- **Google Slides**
  - Employed to compile and present the findings in a structured and visually appealing format. The presentation integrates data insights and visualizations to support strategic recommendations for Eniac's expansion into Brazil.

## Summary of Key Insights

- **Product Fit**: The analysis explored whether Eniac's Apple-compatible accessories would be successful in Brazilian marketplaces, given the region's specific consumer preferences and market conditions. The findings indicated that while there is some alignment between Magist's product categories and Eniac’s offerings, the overall market for high-end tech products remains uncertain. This is particularly relevant considering Magist’s focus on connecting smaller stores, which may not cater primarily to high-end tech buyers.

- **Sales Distribution**: The data showed that Magist's sales are concentrated in major economic regions like São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais, where consumer purchasing power is higher. However, sales are notably lower in the northern regions of Brazil, where lower average incomes and logistical challenges could hinder Eniac's success. This geographic disparity could affect the scalability of Eniac's business model in Brazil.

- **Delivery Performance**: The project assessed delivery times across various regions in Brazil, evaluating whether Magist's logistics network could meet Eniac’s standards for fast and reliable deliveries. While delivery times in major cities are acceptable (in the order of 1 week), delivery to more remote areas, especially in the north, can take up to 4 weeks. This could be a significant drawback for Eniac, where fast delivery is a key component of customer satisfaction. The observed delivery times, however, represent well the typical times of competitors and the overall postal system in Brazil.

- **Customer Satisfaction**: Magist's services have generally received positive reviews, with an average rating of 4.1 out of 5. This suggests a strong base of satisfied customers, although there are isolated complaints about delivery issues and product defects. These reviews indicate that while Magist has a good reputation, there are still potential risks in customer experience that Eniac needs to consider.

- **Final Conclusion**: Our study concludes that while partnering with Magist could be beneficial, skalability concerns lead to the advise that alternatives like Mercado Libre, Novatrade, or the fulfillment services of bigger players like Amazon or Shopify should be considered beforehand.
